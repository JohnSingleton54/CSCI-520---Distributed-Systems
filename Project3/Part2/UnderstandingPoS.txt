slashing - After a validator is selected, but before his stake is returned and his forging reward is
granted, the nodes on the network have to okay the block. If they find the block to be fraudulent,
then his forging reward is not granted and his stake is slashed (lost). (Where does his stake go?)

There will be a fixed number of coins circulating in the network.

An entity can gain coins either by receving them in a txn or by forging a new block (assuming that
the block is okayed).

An entity can lose coins either by sending them in a txn, by txn fee, or by being slashed.

Q: Does an entity have to stake his entire amount of coins?
